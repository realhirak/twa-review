The example app of using Review My TWA.js

[Download](https://github.com/realhirak/twa-review/raw/refs/heads/main/Review-My-TWA-Test.apk) and Install the example app to see the review dialog in-work.

Usually, we need to wait at least 1 day to see the review dialog (because ReviewMyTWA.showAfter(1); is set). To bypass the waiting, follow:

1. Open the test app for the first time after installation.  
2. Close the app.  
3. Change your device date to 2 days in the future.  
4. Re-launch the app â€” you will see the review dialog.

> Note: This app is not in the Play Store, so you will see a not found page in the play store when click on the Review button within the dialog.
