The example app of using [Review My TWA.js](https://github.com/realhirak/review-my-twa)

[Download](https://github.com/realhirak/twa-review/raw/refs/heads/main/Review-My-TWA-Test.apk) and Install the example app to see the review dialog in-work.

Usually, we need to wait at least 4 day to see the review dialog (because ReviewMyTWA.showAfter(3); is set). To bypass the waiting, follow:

1. Open the test app for the first time after installation.  
2. After few seconds, close the app.  
3. Change your device date to 4 days in the future.  
4. Re-launch the app â€” you will see the review dialog.

> Note: This app is not in the Play Store, so you will see a not found page in the play store when click on the Review button within the dialog.
